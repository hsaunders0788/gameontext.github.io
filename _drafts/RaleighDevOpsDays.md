Last week, Game On made its debut at DevOps Days in Raleigh, NC in the hands of myself, Heather Saunders, and three other WebSphere team members local to Raleigh: Venu Beyagudem, Jarek Gawor, and Ranjan Kumar.

DevOps days is a series of conferences across the world that covers topics of software development, IT infrastructure, and of course the DevOps principals that connect them and make them tick. Topics for speeches range from monitoring tool selection, to organizational culture. If you’re interested in seeing if DevOps days is coming near you, check out [The DevOps Days Homepage] (https://www.devopsdays.org).

IBM signed on as a sponsor for the Raleigh conference, as well as a few others (find us in Ohio in November), and wanted a little something more than just promotional material at the booth, so they asked if anyone might be able to present Game On alongside the usual devops and developer tools.

As it turns out, Game On was the perfect medium for engaging the attendees at the conference, who were mostly developers and devops professionals like us, and were often interested in the Game On game and community. Once we explained that IBM was interested in helping developers learn in a fun and connected open source way, almost all the participants were interested in hearing more. A few even forgot that they had only approached the table to get their “conference passport” stamped in the first place.

I look forward to seeing how the game grows as a result of introducing it straight to developers at events like this, and am glad to have joined the Game On community myself!
